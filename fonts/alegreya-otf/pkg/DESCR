Alegreya Sans is a humanist sans serif family with a calligraphic feeling
that conveys a dynamic and varied rhythm. This gives a pleasant feeling
to readers of long texts. This is the OpenType version.

The family follows humanist proportions and principles, just like the
serif version of the family, Alegreya. It achieves a ludic and
harmonious paragraph through elements carefully designed in an
atmosphere of diversity.

The italics bring a strong emphasis to the roman styles, and each have
seven weights to bring you a wide typographic palette.

Alegreya Sans provides for advanced typography with OpenType Features
such as small caps, ligatures, fractions, four set of figures, super
and subscript characters, ordinals, localized accent forms for Catalan,
Guaran'i, Romanian, Turkish, and others.

The Alegreya type system is a "super family", originally intended for
literature, and includes sans and serif sister families.
