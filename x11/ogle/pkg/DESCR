Ogle is a dvd player with support for menus and subtitles, and fairly
good audio/video synchronization.

Other video applications like mplayer and vlc exist, that play more
video formats, and can play mpeg2 video from the disk, but ogle
currently has better synchronization and extensive menu support.
